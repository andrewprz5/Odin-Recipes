# Odin-Recipes

This is a website that contains a list of food recipes.

Links are provided that will take you directly to these recipes on 
their respective websites. This project will show I have demonstrated
some basic HTML skills, such as being able to create a list, provide
links and attach them to specific texts, and provide images to make 
the site more appealing.
